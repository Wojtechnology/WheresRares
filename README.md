## Details
The pretrained model was taken from https://github.com/shihenw/convolutional-pose-machines-release,
and the research paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00134v4.pdf.

Code can be found under `vision/src`.

## Future Steps
* Optimize code to be more performant.
* Rewrite and retrain model in tensorflow.
